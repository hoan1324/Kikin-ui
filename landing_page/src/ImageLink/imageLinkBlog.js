                            "Debt, a concept rooted in ancient civilisations, has been integral to the evolution of commerce and enterprise. Its inception dates back to the early days of Mesopotamia, where farmers borrowed seeds with the promise of repayment alongside interest upon a successful harvest. Over millennia, debt has undergone transformations, from its prohibition during the Middle Ages to its resurgence with the advent of joint-stock companies in the 16th century, laying the groundwork for modern corporate financing. Yet, it was venture capital that became the fuel for building start-ups. "

                            "The inception of joint-stock companies coincided with the emergence of venture capital principles, where investors sought ownership in high-risk, high-reward ventures akin to modern-day start-ups. Drawing parallels to historical whale expeditions, these early investors understood the importance of diversification to mitigate risks—a principle mirrored in today's venture capital landscape through the Power Law. Despite its potential for outsized returns, the Power Law's penchant for risk-taking often places founders in a precarious position, necessitating substantial ownership concessions to fuel their ventures"

At Kikin, we recognise that traditional funding avenues may not suit every entrepreneurial endeavour, and venture capital tends to ignore good business if it isn’t likely to meet the returns demanded by the power law. With many good start-ups not able to raise venture capital more traditional debt financing has also not been able to keep up with the demand. In 2019, a study suggested that there was a $77billion SME funding gap. Start-ups face many hurdles in accessing debt financing due to risk aversion among lenders and the complexity of assessing early-stage companies' viability. However, recent advancements in open banking, artificial intelligence, and risk modelling have shifted the tide in favour of start-up debt funding.",

By understanding the unique needs of early-stage ventures, Kikin facilitates inventory financing without cumbersome setup fees or stringent collateral requirements. This approach empowers start-ups to allocate capital efficiently, freeing up resources for crucial growth initiatives while mitigating equity dilution."

                                    "High Legal Fees: Equity financing typically involves complex legal agreements, leading to substantial legal fees. These fees range from modest amounts for early-stage funding rounds to significant expenses for later-stage investments, further eating into the start-up's resources. Most businesses are now expected to cover the legal expenses of their new investors! ",
                                    "Loss of Control: In addition to dilution, equity funding may result in a loss of control over key business decisions. Investors often demand seats on the board or veto rights, potentially limiting the founder's autonomy in steering the company's direction.",

Having Rob on the board will certainly unlock our capacity to reach further and impact more businesses. Our platform's cutting-edge algorithms and seamless integrations not only offer a solution but foster a digital ecosystem that aligns with our commitment to sustainability and purpose-driven growth. Having a Chair who stands behind those values is critical to Kikin’s success.'",

                "Trends suggest that consumers are adopting various measures to shop and live more sustainably, with Deloitte reporting that four out of five UK consumers adopted a more sustainable lifestyle choice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research before the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the announcement of a corporate social responsibility program positively affects brand performance, and consumers are more likely to purchase products from companies that promote sustainability. Consumer brands are increasingly being challenged to make more sustainable choices as customers embrace sustainability. Yet, the cost of producing the right choice for the planet is often proportionally higher than unfriendly planet options. "

This challenge increased with the COVID-19 pandemic and global inflation pressures following the pandemic, leading to rising production costs, shipping backlogs, labour shortages and less availability of raw materials. Whilst this might be easier for larger, more established companies to navigate, who can borrow at lower rates and make demands on their suppliers and customers, this is different for early-stage or start-ups. There's a margin sacrifice associated with sustainable choices for early-stage companies, which requires an increase in capital to be able to produce products with impact in mind. A report from HSBC stated that a quarter of small businesses believe that focusing on environmental sustainability will grow their business in the next 12 months but highlighted the cost of funding sustainability plans as a critical barrier.

Our mission is to help good businesses grow, which is why we reward sustainable companies with lower fees, freeing up cash for sustainable choices. Kikin was designed by founders who have built consumer brands, understand the importance of cash conversion cycles and have navigated the challenges of suppliers asking to be paid upfront. Using our proprietary algorithms, artificial intelligence and the latest developments in open banking and risk analysis tools, we can fund businesses at every stage of their growth. Our funding automatically updates as your company grows, so you can always get the right amount of funds to support buying enough products to meet demand whilst not negatively impacting cash conversion.",
                            "Choosing sustainable options at a start-up comes at a premium. Yet start-ups can not afford the resources to consistently report on the ESG requirements to access green financing of sustainability-linked loans. At Kikin, we can help solve this problem. Thanks to the introduction of impact and ESG accreditations, many start-ups can certify their ESG credentials. This is why at Kikin, we can discount the cost of funding for companies that are a B-Corp (certified or pending), donate to 1% for the planet, or verify offsetting their carbon footprint. Whilst these accreditations aren't recognised by the traditional banks, the founders of Kikin have certified B-Corps, donated to 1% for the Planet, offset their carbon footprints and know the value this brings in holding start-ups accountable for their impact. ",

Kikin aims to support the flow of capital towards innovators, builders, SMEs, entrepreneurs, founders and change-makers who can own more of their company whilst they attempt to rewire the consumer goods economy and set us on a path towards a healthier planet.
